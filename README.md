Flexible Mapping
When we create an entity, sometimes we only use properties which will represent columns in a table, in sqlserver Typically this is fine.
But there may be other locations in which we may want to use a combination of properties and fields.
The idea is that we may want to use a field to represent our column in the sqlserver table. We will use the property to do a transformation 
over the data that we are about to insert or modify. We call this flexible mapping.
